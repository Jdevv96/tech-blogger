# Tech-Blogger
Thanks for checking out my project! Follow me through my journey as I tackle new projects and document the process along the way!

## Summary: 
The idea behind Tech-Blogger, is an app that'll house and document my progress and journey as a developer, offering more insight on what projects I'm working on, tools I'm practicing and much more. Not only as a way to hold myself accountable in learning in this ever-evolving world of tech, but also to offer help and guidance to any fellow developers on their journey.

### Check out my progress and recent Sprints

<details>
  <summary>Sprint 1: Login and Registration functionality</summary>
  <br>
  Goal: 
  
  The goal of this sprint was to implement a robust login component for the backend that will allow new users to register for an account as well as logging in. I also wanted to ensure the password and user data was being stored in a secure way.

  User Stories:
  
  1. As a non-user, I should be able to register and create an account to access the user features(to be implemented in future sprint).
  2. As a registered user, I should be able to login to my account securely.
  <hr>
  Challenges: 
  
  Implementing the authentication filter was the most challenging part so far, as it's a delicate process and I needed to make sure I got the steps right in order to properly filter each request.
  <br>
  <hr>
  Timeline:
  
  To keep the project to a manageable length, I wanted to give myself a 7 days to learn more about Spring Security and particularly about implementing Authorization and Authentication techniques when paired with Spring Security 6. 
  
  Sprint Start: 6/19/23
  
  Sprint Finish: TBD
