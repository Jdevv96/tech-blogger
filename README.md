# Tech-Blogger
Thanks for checking out my project! Follow me through my journey as I tackle new projects and document the process along the way!

## Summary: 
The idea behind Tech-Blogger, is an app that'll house and document my progress and journey as a developer, offering more insight on what projects I'm working on, tools I'm practicing and much more. Not only as a way to hold myself accountable in learning in this ever-evolving world of tech, but also to offer help and guidance to any fellow developers on their journey.

### Check out my progress and recent Sprints

<details>
  <summary>Sprint 1: Login and Registration Functionality</summary>

  
  ### Goal:

The goal of this sprint was to implement a robust login component for the backend that will allow new users to register for an account as well as logging in. I also wanted to ensure the password and user data was being stored in a secure way.

---

### User Stories:

1. As a non-user, I should be able to register and create an account to access the user features(to be implemented in future sprint).
2. As a registered user, I should be able to login to my account securely.

---

### Challenges:

Implementing the authentication filter was the most challenging part so far, as it's a delicate process and I needed to make sure I got the steps right in order to properly filter each request.

---

### Timeline:

To keep the project to a manageable length, I wanted to give myself a 7 days to learn more about Spring Security and particularly about implementing Authorization and Authentication techniques when paired with Spring Security 6.

Sprint Start: 6/19/23

Sprint Finish: 6/22/2023

---

### Testing:

Testing for this feature was conducted via Postman and endpoint testing.

  <summary>Sprint 2: Post - Admin Only</summary>

### Goal:

The goal of this sprint is to complete the implementation of the repository, entity and services files in order to start CRUD functionality testing for Post feature (should be available only to Admin). Also to create and design a functional database that accurately reflects the properties and features the app will have. 

By the end of this Sprint, I should be able to test the ability for an ADMIN to securely post a blog while a USER should only have read access. I should also be able to successfully test the accuracy of joining tables.

---

### User Stories:

1. As an Admin, I should be able to create, read, update and delete a blog post.
2. As a User, I should have access to reading a blog post.
