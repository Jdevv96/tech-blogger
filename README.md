# Tech-Blogger
Thanks for checking out my project! Follow me through my journey as I tackle new projects and document the process along the way!

## Summary: 
The idea behind Tech-Blogger, is an app that'll house and document my progress and journey as a developer, offering more insight on what projects I'm working on, tools I'm using to practice with and much more. Not only as a way to hold myself accountable in learning, in this ever-evolving world of tech, but also to offer help and guidance to any fellow developers on their journey.
